1. Project Overview
This repository contains my solutions and implementations for the Kaggle Intermediate Machine Learning course. The goal was to move beyond basic modeling and focus on the technical workflows required to build robust, production-ready ML models.
2. Key Concepts Covered
Handling Missing Values: Comparing Mean/Median Imputation with Extension Imputation.
Categorical Variables: Implementing Ordinal Encoding and One-Hot Encoding.
Pipelines: Using scikit-learn Pipelines to bundle preprocessing and modeling steps for cleaner, more bug-resistant code.
Cross-Validation: Utilizing $K$-fold cross-validation to get better measures of model performance.
XGBoost: Implementing Gradient Boosting to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on tabular datasets.
Data Leakage: Identifying and preventing target leakage and train-test contamination.
3. Technologies Used
Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost
Platform: Kaggle Kernels / Jupyter Notebooks
4. How to Use
Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/malaikaahsan/Kaggle-Intermediate-ML.git
Navigate to the notebooks to see the step-by-step implementation of each technique.
The datasets used are primarily from the Melbourne Housing and Ames Housing competitions.
